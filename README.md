## question answer:

Graceful degradation means a website can still work even if some newer features are not supported or if the internet is not working well. Service workers help with this because they let the site save important files (like data, images, or scripts) so it can load even without internet. This makes the app more reliable. Even if the network is slow or offline, users can still see content and use the site like normal.
